# generator-aurelia-es2016

This is a fork of [zewa666's generator-aurelia](https://github.com/zewa666/generator-aurelia), with a few tweaks for my own personal preference.

Main difference:
- Folder is structured in a [modlet](https://donejs.com/Features.html#section=section_Modlets) way, e.g. putting the view and its corresponding viewModel in the same folder.
- Subgenerators for service/components/pages.
- No longer download from the Skeleton App first, templates are local.
- Only support ES6 for now.

TODO:
- Include CSS / LESS for modlets.
- Support other project types from the Skeleton App template.
- Find a more elegant way to do routes for sub folders.

This is a Yeoman Generator for the [Skeleton App](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation) of the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform. It sets up a standard navigation-style app using gulp to build your ES6 code with [Babel](http://babeljs.io). Karma/Jasmine testing is configured as well.

For more info please visit the official site: http://www.aurelia.io/

## Prerequisite
This generator will use [JSPM](http://jspm.io), Aurelias package manager of choice, which performs GitHub queries to install semver packages, but GitHub has a rate limit on anonymous API requests. It is advised that you configure jspm with your GitHub credentials in order to avoid problems. You can do this by executing `jspm registry config github` and following the prompts. If you choose to authorize jspm by an access token instead of giving your password (see GitHub Settings > Personal Access Tokens), `public_repo` access for the token is required.

## Running The App

> The recent update will take care of running `npm install` and `jspm install` after downloading the boilerplate app, so this shortens the process to get up and running.

1. Verify that Yeoman is installed

  ```shell
  npm install -g yo
  ```
2. Install this generator

  ```shell
  npm install -g generator-aurelia
  ```

3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```

5. Create a new project folder and move into it in the terminal

  ```shell
  mkdir YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
  cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
  ```

6. Use Github API Token if the generator prompts a rate limit error. Execute the following command:

  ```shell
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
  ```
  
  > Windows users should set a user environment variable called GITHUB_TOKEN with the value being your actual token. 

7. Execute the following command

  ```shell
  yo aurelia
  ```

8. To run the app, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  gulp watch
  ```
9. Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under `src` and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.

## Update the skeleton jspm dependencies
If you're inside your skeleton folder you can run the following command to update your installation and get the latest versions of the dependencies used:

  ```shell
  yo aurelia:update
  ```

## Command line options

### --skip-install
yo aurelia --skip-install will skip the npm and jspm install.

### --proxy
yo aurelia --proxy=http://my.proxy:8080 will install the skeleton app resepecting the given proxy settings

## Creating a new page
In order to create a new Aurelia Page just enter the following command inside your project root:

  ```shell
  yo aurelia:page YOURPAGENAME
  ```

> If you get an error like `Error: spawn git ENOENT` when executing the yo command, you should check whether GIT is installed and accessible from the command line

This will create a View and ViewModel with the given name inside the ```./src``` folder
